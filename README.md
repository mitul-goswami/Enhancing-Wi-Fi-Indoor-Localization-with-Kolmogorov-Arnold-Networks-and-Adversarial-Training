The study focuses on enhancing the robustness of Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning systems against adversarial attacks. The goal is to improve the positioning accuracy and resilience of these systems under two attack scenarios: Wi-Fi spoofing and signal strength manipulation. Three models are developed and evaluated: a baseline model (M_base), an adversarially trained robust model (M_rob), and an ensemble model (M_ens). All models utilize a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture. The robust model is trained with adversarially perturbed data, while the ensemble model combines predictions from both the base and robust models.
